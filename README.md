# DroidVan
This repo contains my experimental Android app to control lights, fans and other elements of my campervan using a RaspberryPi.

The raspberryPi side can be found in the [RaspVan repo](https://github.com/jmrf/RaspVan).



## TO-DO:

* Currently exploring Android DrawerLayout. All Activities should be selected from there. Manual light switches, light timers, fan control, cameras, etc... (one for each control type)

* Add light-timer activity
